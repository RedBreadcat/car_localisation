Follow this to install TensorFlow Object Detection: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md

But instead put a line in the form of this into .bashrc:
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/roby/git/models/research/:/home/roby/git/models/research/slim/



Prereqs:
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-ros-control ros-kinetic-ros-controllers ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-control
